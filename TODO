1: even when deploy fails it updates the .dep file while the .last does not chnage which is coorect

2: it shows deployment success but internally it failed so adding a proper health check

3: make health check beacuse it is able to pull wromg images as well
nginx-app-58dfbffbd9-6wmjv   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          112s
//but msg says success

4: when a new ns is added it does not fill the .last file
test              Active   22s
[ERROR] Deployment failed: deployments.apps "nginx-app" not found
file name is is \Users\win 10\Desktop\GO\K8sEngine\deps\nginx-app_test.dep
 the new version = nginx-1.24.0 old is = 
2026/01/15 09:07:20  Full image : 810244486469.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sessionvault:nginx-1.24.0
2026/01/15 09:07:20  failed to get deployements error  in extractor.go 
 [ERROR] Deployment failed: deployments.apps "nginx-app" not found


6: mapping eror is better to get proper slack messages

7:the rollback logic is asgood since when a deployement fails it does not deltet the old image so the olny thing left is to have a k8s health check and later if deployment has faield rollback the filechanges without triggering a fsnotify even it triggers k8s uses canary ones cause it deploys new and removes old even though same


8:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it stucks in the loop of redeployement as it changes the file .dep and not .last which triggers the job again

adding the secletor using in healthcheck
